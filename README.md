# half-mapper

This repo is a fork and complete rework of the [half-mapper repository by gzalo](https://github.com/gzalo/HalfMapper).
The build system and renderer were completely stripped, The app now uses [Daxa](https://github.com/Ipotrick/Daxa) to render
everything, and I added imgui and imguizmo to allow for in-app editing.
